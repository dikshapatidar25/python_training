Do you know what Mississippi is?
It's the name of one of the states and rivers in the United States. The Mississippi River is about 2,340 miles
long, which makes it the second longest river in the United States (the longest being the Missouri River). It's so
long that a single drop of water needs 90 days to travel its entire length!
The word Mississippi is also used for a slightly different purpose: to count mississippily.
If you're not familiar with the phrase, we're here to explain to you what it means: it's used to count seconds.
The idea behind it is that adding the word Mississippi to a number when counting seconds aloud makes them
sound closer to clock-time, and therefore "one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi" will take
approximately an actual three seconds of time! It's often used by children playing hide-and-seek to make sure
the seeker does an honest count.
Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippily" to five. Having
counted to five, the program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"

Your program must:
● ask the user to enter a word;
● use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll
talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon – don't worry;
● use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from
the inputted word;
● print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.
